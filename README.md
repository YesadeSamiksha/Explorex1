Project Structure

```

Explorex1/
│
├── index.html / index2.html         # Main HTML pages
├── index.php                        # PHP script or backend file
├── main.js, main1.js                # JavaScript files for interactivity
├── style.css, style2.css            # Stylesheets for design & layout
├── img1.avif, i2.jpeg               # Image/media assets
├── video.mp4                        # Video/media assets 
│
└── other files (if any)            # Additional files for features

````

This layout keeps frontend assets, media (images/videos), stylesheets, scripts, and HTML/PHP pages well organized, making it easy to maintain and extend.

Technologies Used

- Frontend: HTML, CSS  
- Interactive Behavior: JavaScript  
- Optional Backend / Server-Side:PHP (if `index.php` is used) / other as needed  
- Media & Assets: Images (e.g. `.avif`, `.jpeg`), Videos (e.g. `.mp4`)  
- General: Responsive design, clean UI, cross-browser compatibility

How to View / Run Locally

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YesadeSamiksha/Explorex1.git
   cd Explorex1
````

2. If your project uses a backend (e.g. PHP), ensure you have a local server or use a local HTTP server like live-server / PHP built-in server / XAMPP / etc.

3. Otherwise, open the HTML file (e.g. `index.html`) directly in your browser to view the site — all front-end logic and media assets should load correctly.

4. For any JS functionality or interactive features, make sure the linked `.js` files and asset paths remain correct relative to the HTML.

What Makes Explorex1 Stand Out

* Clean design and layout — with emphasis on visuals (images / videos) and smooth UI
* Simple yet effective architecture — assets separated logically, easy to understand and extend
* Multi-file structure suitable for learning and building full-fledged frontend projects
* Ready-to-use as a base for further expansion: you can add backend, database, interactivity, user-auth, etc.

---

To-Do / Future Improvements (Roadmap)

* Add backend support (e.g. user authentication, dynamic content fetching)
* Improve UI/UX — make design responsive, polished and mobile-friendly
* Optimize assets — compress images/videos, lazy-load for performance
* Add interactive features — such as dynamic galleries, filtering, or search
* Modularize code — separate JS/CSS into components or modules for maintainability
